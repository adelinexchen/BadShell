# Bad Shell
## I am on the journey to write a bad shell. 

### How to run
./shell

### What works so far
* history (could be more speace efficient and readable)
* pwd, ls, echo, cat, mv, 
* cd, exit command
* colours changing at random
* growing weiner

### What I am working on
* arrow key functions

### What I'd like to add
* redirection
* tab to autocomplete
