# Bad Shell
## I am on the journey to write a bad shell. 

### What works so far
* history (kind of)
* pwd, ls, echo, cat, mv, cd, exit command

### What is yet to work

### What I'd like to add
* up down arrow keys
* colours changing at random
* growing weiner
* autocomplete (i think this might be impossible)
